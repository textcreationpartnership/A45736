            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>TO ≈øeek out an Excu≈øe of this my Boldne≈øs, and to arm the Acknowledgment of a Fault with the Rea≈øons for it, might better ≈øhew I knew I did ami≈øs, than any way dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the Attempt: therefore I intend to carry no other Olive-Branch of Interce≈ø≈øion than a cleer manife≈øtation of the Truth of ≈øuch things wherein I do humbly conceive you Err, ≈øome of you; not wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, yet for want of a due and ≈øerious Con≈øideration of the great Obligation of humane Laws in things which in their own nature are indifferent. One of which is the place for reading of the ≈øecond Service; which place, without all doubt, is a thing in its own nature indifferent: But when a lawful Authority ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a certain place, although in its own nature the place remains ≈øtill indifferent, yet the u≈øe of that place is not indifferent, but becomes nece≈ø≈øary by rea≈øon of the command, to which the nece≈ø≈øity of Obedience is in≈øeparably annexed.</p>
            <p>If this be a fal≈øe Po≈øition, I have nothing more to ≈øay, but if it be true, then do you err in point of Practice, which is not according to the e≈øtabli≈øh'd Rule, our Church appointing one certain place, and you read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another; and ≈øo by this means teaching the People this dangerous Principle, that things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65719:3"/>in their own Nature, remain ≈øo as to their u≈øe after a lawful Command, for the doing, or not doing of any ≈øuch indifferent things, as they were before ≈øuch Command or Prohibition. A Principle which undermines the Foundation of the whole Church; and being once admitted, leaves us naked and defencele≈øs again≈øt all the Weapons that are or may be formed, either by the Papi≈øt or Puritan, again≈øt the mo≈øt glorious Church in the World. And if we, who pro≈øe≈øs our ≈øelves to be Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ≈øhould embrace this mi≈øchievous Tenet, our Church will be ≈øo much militant again≈øgt her ≈øelf, that her Enemies will in a very ≈øhort time become Triumphant. They ≈øeeing your practice evidently built upon this ≈øandy Fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ndation, do on all ≈øides hit us in the Teeth with the≈øe things, and laugh us to ≈øcorn.</p>
            <p>Why do you charge us with Nonconformity and Di≈øobedience to humane Laws, which are but things indifferent, notwith≈øtanding the Command. (≈øay they) for do not mo≈øt of your Clergy e≈øteem them as ≈øuch, when they omit what Rite and Ceremony they plea≈øe, though never ≈øo ≈øtrictly injoined by the ≈øupreme Authority? Do the≈øe things oblige our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences, and are theirs only free? If it be ≈øo, then we perceive plainly that the only way to enjoy liberty of Con≈øcience, is to be a Clergy-Man of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what ≈øhall we ≈øay to the≈øe things? If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the matter of Fact, our Church Enemies charge us with Impudence, if we confe≈øs it (as to keep our ≈øelves from lying we are forc'd to do) then they charge our reverend Clergy with the ≈øame Crimes we u≈øually appropriate to the greate≈øt Phanatick, <hi>viz.</hi> Di≈øobedience to the lawful Magi≈øtrate, and Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the e≈øtabli≈øh'd Orders of the Church. How
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65719:3"/>to avoid the Horns of this Dilemma, I do ≈øincerely declare I know not.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhould be very glad if any of you would be pleas'd to tell me a full An≈øwer that I may give to the≈øe trouble≈øom People, who have gagg'd me ≈øo often with the≈øe things, that I am altogether become dumb, and am a≈øhamed to receive ≈øo many Baffles from tho≈øe Fools who make a mock of Sin.</p>
            <p>I thank God I can defend my ≈øelf well enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all the frivolous and captious Exceptions which have been either made or taken by the Recu≈øant or the Di≈ø≈øenter again≈øt the e≈øtabli≈øhed Doctrine, Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Wor≈øhip of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but if they talk to me of any thing that is ≈øaid or done in our Churches, which is not warranted by the XXXIX. Articles, by the Book of Canons, by the Book of Common Prayer, or by the con≈øtant univer≈øal Practice of the Catholick Church of Chri≈øt; they had as good talk to me of the Roman Breviary, or the Engli≈øh Directory, and I can as ≈øoon ju≈øtify the ≈øaying, either of them in our Churches, as any thing I have before mentioned.</p>
            <p>True it is, that we have a mo≈øt excellent Liturgy e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Law of the Land, but in very many places little or no care had that the Subjects may have it whole and intire, without mangling and curtailing in ≈øuch a ≈øhameful manner that by the≈øe ≈øacrilegious ways our ≈øacred Book of Common Prayer is become contemptible, and the People are come to this pa≈øs, even downright to declare their abhorrence of our religious A≈ø≈øemblies; when in≈øtead of paying that ≈øolemn Wor≈øhip to God, which by the Laws of our Nation are devoted to him, we wor≈øhip him after our own Imaginations, and hereby offer him the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Fools, which he will in no wi≈øe accept.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65719:4"/>
            <p> Although I could in≈øtance in ≈øundry Particulars, yet at this time I ≈øhall onely name one, which is reading the Communion Service in the Desk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you take upon you to break an authori≈øed Order of our Church, and to make a new one: The appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which Order pertaineth not to private Men (as our Church ≈øaith very truly) therefore no Man ought to take in hand, or pre≈øume to appoint or alter any publick or common Order in Chri≈øt's Church, except he be lawfully called and authorized thereunto.</p>
            <p>Either you believe this to be true or fal≈øe; if true, then you wilfully and contemptuou≈øly tran≈øgre≈øs and break a common Order and Di≈øcipline when≈øoever you omit or alter a Rite or Ceremony appointed by the Church, which though in its ≈øelf con≈øidered, is but a ≈ømall thing, yet by rea≈øon of the Contempt, that is in≈øeparably annexed to the Offence in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon knowing, and being verily per≈øwaded of the Truth hereof, it is no ≈ømall Offence before God, that is in plain Engli≈øh, it is a very great Sin.</p>
            <p>Now if it ≈øhould ≈øo happen that any of you are of another Per≈øwa≈øion, and ≈øo you are Di≈ø≈øenters in your Judgment, as well as in your Practice, why then did you ≈øub≈øcribe to the ≈øecond Article mentioned in the XXXVI. Canon, and play fa≈øt and loo≈øe with God Almighty, and put Tricks upon your own Mother the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Do you think that God will be mocked, or permit his holy Spou≈øe to be cheated? How can you, or any other be ≈øaid to u≈øe the Form pre≈øcribed in publick Prayer and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration of the Sacraments, and none other, which you have promi≈øed to do by your Sub≈øcription, which is a ≈øacred Tie, and yet immediately after willingly omit, or alter any one Rite or Ceremony, without a great perfidiou≈øne≈øs!</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65719:4"/>
            <p> As to the Point of reading the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice when there is no Communion, I do po≈øitively a≈ø≈øert, that it is appointed by our Church to be read at the North ≈øide of the Holy Table, and that who≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reads it at any other place, breaks the Order of our Church, and if he doth it through his private Judgment willingly and purpo≈øely (as he cannot be pre≈øumed to do otherwi≈øe who is fully convinced that the Church hath ≈øo appointed it) he doth not only offend again≈øt the common order of the Church, but hurteth the Authority of the Magi≈øtrate, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Con≈øciences of the weak Brethren!</p>
            <p>Herein I have two ≈øorts of Per≈øons to deal withal, one plainly confe≈ø≈øing, that 'tis-commanded by the Church, and thereby ≈øaving me the trouble of a Proof, but ≈øaying withal that he is at liberty notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the Command, and he offers ≈øome ≈øeeming Rea≈øons for his altering the appointed Place, and ≈øays they are ≈øufficient to ju≈øtify his Practice both before God and Man, and whether they be ≈øo or no, you will ≈øee by and by.</p>
            <p>There is another ≈øort of men who knowing not how to ju≈øtify their pre≈øent Practice contrary to a plain Injunction of Authority, are forced to make u≈øe of an <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> and having thereby in their own Conceit quite expung'd the Rubrick as to this Purpo≈øe, confidently tell me there is no ≈øuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand when there is no Communion, therefore no di≈øobedience to that Authority which they own, and are both ready and willing to obey.</p>
            <p>To every one of you (dear Sirs) who own the thing which others deny, I mu≈øt an≈øwer with an <hi>ex ore tuo te Judico:</hi> for you ingeniou≈øly confe≈øs that 'tis commanded by the Church, and yet at the ≈øame time mo≈øt di≈øingeniou≈øly prefer a corrupt Practice of ≈øome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65719:5"/>ill principled men before your known Duty.</p>
            <p>And for this you make ≈øeveral Pleas. Fir≈øt, you ≈øay 'tis the Cu≈øtom of mo≈øt Pari≈øh Churches to read the ≈øecond Service in the Desk: and Cu≈øtom in the major part of any Society, hath the force of a Law, and a Law which is introduced by Cu≈øtom, is as much a Law as any Statute Law of the Land, becau≈øe a Law doth not <hi>recipere magis &amp; minus,</hi> and if you do obey that Law which Cu≈øtom hath made ≈øo, you are as much obedient to the Law, as he that obeys an Act of Parliament. But how weak and in≈øufficient this Plea is, judg you your own ≈øelves, when you have well con≈øidered the fal≈øe Notions of ≈øuch a Cu≈øtom, which you too fa≈øt do run away with, not making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny di≈øtinction between <hi>corruptela,</hi> and <hi>con≈øuetudo,</hi> and little regarding the ≈ømall force ≈øuch a Cu≈øtom (≈øetting a≈øide the Corruption) hath to ≈øway any Mans Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who is rightly informed of the truth of this matter.</p>
            <p>Now certainly mo≈øt true it is, that a con≈øtant uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Cu≈øtom or Practice of a whole National Church hath the force of a Law, and ought without all doubt to be ob≈øerved; but then you mu≈øt take this along with you, provided that no po≈øitive Law of the Kingdom intervene to annul that Cu≈øtom, Practice, or what you will call it, otherwi≈øe the Rule is fal≈øe: For to plead Cu≈øtom again≈øt po≈øitive Law, is to plead that which was the Law again≈øt that which is the Law; the ≈øole intent of all po≈øitive Laws, being to take away the binding power of all cu≈øtomary Laws to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, otherwi≈øe there would be two Laws in being at one and the ≈øame time, commanding the one contrary to the other, which would certainly breed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion which all po≈øitive Laws are de≈øigned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65719:5"/>
            <p> I Pray Gentlemen be plea≈øed to con≈øider what Mi≈øchief you do both to Church and State, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring ≈øuch a Cu≈øtom as this before an e≈øtabli≈øhed Law to the contrary: Do not you by this means turn our golden Liturgy into a leaden Directory, and the be≈øt of Churches into the wor≈øt of Conventicles? You may laugh as much you plea≈øe, but this is a great Truth, becau≈øe it is neither the Place, nor the Number of Per≈øons meeting together that makes a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, for the≈øe may be Riots, Routs, or unlawful A≈ø≈øemblies: but that which doth con≈øtitute it a Conventicle, and from which it receives its true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, is the meeting in any Place above ≈øuch a limited Number, and Serving God otherwi≈øe than according to the e≈øtabli≈øhed Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which may be done in a Church as well as a Barn, as ≈øad Experience tells. It is only the Ob≈øervation, or non-Ob≈øervation of all the Orders, Rites, and Ceremonies (and none other) which are appointed in and by the Common Prayer and Book of Canons, which gives it the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church or Conventicle. If all the Orders be regularly ob≈øerved without Addition or Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in Matter or Form, 'tis a true Church, and a right Church: but if any thing be Said, Sung, or done, in Church, or in private Hou≈øes (where there are above ≈øuch a Number as the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points) as the publick Wor≈øhip of God, which is not warranted by the Book of Common Prayer, or by ≈øome Law of the ≈øupreme Governour both in Church and State, although hereby it cea≈øes not to be a true Church, yet it cea≈øes to be a right Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences to be a true Conventicle, for I know no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between a right Church, and a true Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, every Meeting upon the pretence of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65719:6"/>of Religion; being the one or the other.</p>
            <p>And ≈øo every Per≈øon in Holy Orders that officiates at Divine Service, is either a thorough Conformi≈øt, or a Non-conformi≈øt, I know no medium in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtabli≈øhed Church (as ours is) but if there be, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to be informed of the≈øe things, to wit, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or how few of the e≈øtabli≈øhed Prayers may be ≈øaid? How many of the Rites and Ceremonies may be u≈øed? Which may be omitted, which altered? Which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitted nor altered? And yet the ≈øame Per≈øon doing or omitting any of the≈øe things, may be, and remain a true Conformi≈øt, for if they be not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a certain number, then he that u≈øes only the Lords Prayer, u≈øes part of the Book of Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the mo≈øt material part too, and may as truly be e≈øteemed as true a Conformi≈øt as he that u≈øes a great deal more, and yet falls ≈øhort of the whole, either as to Matter of Form; for who≈øoever he be that alters or dimini≈øhes willingly in either, he is ≈øo far a Nonconformi≈øt, and how much farther he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, no body knows but him≈øelf; but this we know by common Experience, break Ice in one place, it will crack in a great many more. He that wilfully breaks the ≈ømalle≈øt order of the Church, is fle≈øht for greater matters. How true therefore is that ≈øaying, <hi>MINIMUM NON EST NON NEG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGERE MINIMA?</hi> And what a great deal of Mi≈øchief in the Church would this ≈ømall Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence prevent, if it were believed and put in Practice? for then there would not be ≈øo many <hi>Secundum u≈øum's</hi> as there are nowadayes. Heretofore it was only <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum u≈øum Sarum, ≈øecundum u≈øum Hereforden≈øem, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum u≈øum Bangoren≈øem, ≈øecundum u≈øum Eboracen≈øem, ≈øecundum u≈øum Lincolnien≈øem;</hi> the≈øe were all prime Places, Cathedralls all, and yet at the beginning of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65719:6"/>the Reformation this was thought to be a great Grievance.</p>
            <p>But now every Pari≈øh, be it never ≈øo incon≈øiderable, pre≈øcribes to a <hi>Secundum u≈øum; ≈øecundum U≈øum</hi> this Pari≈øh, <hi>≈øecundum u≈øum</hi> that Pari≈øh; and ≈øo you may go on, and name all the Pari≈øhes of <hi>England</hi> as far as the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> and ≈øo many ≈øeveral Churches, ≈øo many <hi>≈øecundum u≈øum's</hi> there are, and yet the Rule by which they be all to walk, is all one and the ≈øame. Now from henceforth (≈øay's the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Preface concerning the Service of the Church) all the whole Realm ≈øhall have but one U≈øe, and for this very purpo≈øe was a Liturgy compo≈øed to remedy the great Diver≈øities in ≈øaying and ≈øinging in Churches, a Remedy very ≈øage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, but to no purpo≈øe, becau≈øe never put in Practice. So much for that.</p>
            <p>The next Plea I have heard ≈øome of you make u≈øe of, is, that the Bi≈øhop of your Dioce≈øs doth di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øe with your Obedience as to ≈øeveral Rubricks, and in particular to this, which is a plain Confe≈ø≈øion that 'tis enjoin'd by the ≈øupreme Authority, otherwi≈øe, what need is there of a Di≈øpen≈øation? which being ≈øo, what Authority hath the Bi≈øhop, or all the Bi≈øhops together (I ≈øay this with humble Submi≈ø≈øion to that Holy Order, for which no Man hath a greater Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than my ≈øelf) what Authority, I ≈øay, have they to di≈øpen≈øe with a Duty injoyned by Act of Parliament? ≈øure I am, that they may as well Di≈øpen≈øe with the woollen Act, or the Act prohibiting Iri≈øh Cattel, as with the Act of Uniformity. Doth not the Book of Common Prayer it≈øelf, which is e≈øtabli≈øhed by the ≈øaid Act, re≈øtrain all Dioce≈øans from making any order concerning any Doubt ari≈øing about the U≈øe and Practice of any thing in the Book, any order that is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65719:7"/>contrary to any thing contained in this Book?</p>
            <p>Now from hence I argue, If the Communion Service be not appointed by the Rubrick to be read at the North ≈øide of the Table when there is no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ≈øo the reading it in the Desk be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any thing contained in the book, why do you require a needle≈øs Di≈øpen≈øation, and if it be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how can be Bi≈øhop grant it?</p>
            <p>When publick Orders and Con≈øtitutions have been received, and have taken place, ≈øhall general Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto cea≈øe to be exacted, in ca≈øe this or that private Per≈øon led with ≈øome probable Conceit, ≈øhould make open Declaration that <hi>A. B.</hi> Bi≈øhop of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth di≈øpen≈øe with me concerning ≈øuch a Rubrick? And although 'tis granted that the Bi≈øhop him≈øelf is a Per≈øon in a publick Charge and Authority, and all Curates are bound to obey him in <hi>omnibus licitis &amp; hone≈øtis;</hi> yet if the Dioce≈øan ≈øhould command all under his Juri≈ødiction to read the Communion Service in the Desk, the Bi≈øhops Mandate without all doubt mu≈øt give place to the King's Laws, and in all ≈øuch Ca≈øes the King mu≈øt be obeyed, and not the Bi≈øhop, becau≈øe it is neither <hi>licitum</hi> nor <hi>hone≈øtum,</hi> to obey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øubordinate Power, when the Supreme commands otherwi≈øe: Be≈øides, when publick con≈øent of the whole hath e≈øtabli≈øhed any thing, every Man's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being thereunto compared, is private, how≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Calling be to ≈øome kind of publick Charge, otherwi≈øe there could be no means po≈ø≈øible to attain to any Peace or Quietne≈øs either in Church or State, unle≈øs the probable Voice of every intire Society or Body Politick, over-rule all private of like Nature in the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>And this is our Ca≈øe exactly; for 'tis determined by the King with the Con≈øent of the three E≈øtates,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65719:7"/>repre≈øenting the whole Body of the Kingdom, where the ≈øecond Service ≈øhall be ≈øaid; and this is not alterable according to our Laws, but by the ≈øame full Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by which it was enacted; not by any ≈øingle Per≈øon, if he be a Subject, nor by any one of three E≈øtates, nor by all together without the King, which is ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to over-rule the frivolous Plea of a Di≈øpen≈øation, which can never be defended without overturning the Government, by altering the Frame and Con≈øtitution thereof: to ≈øuch ≈øad Exigents are they reduced who undertake to defend what they have not beforehand well con≈øidered of: For who would have imagined, that ≈øo ≈ømall an Omi≈ø≈øion as this at fir≈øt ≈øight ≈øeems to be, ≈øhould ≈øwell to ≈øuch a mountainous Crime as to equal the Popes Pride in contending with the King for the Supremacy, and by little and little to ≈øubvert his Government: which puts me in mind of a Pa≈ø≈øage I have met with in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which jumps even with the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Aemylius,</hi> a noble Roman, and one of the Con≈øuls, afterwards cho≈øen to be one of the number of Prie≈øts, whom the Romans called <hi>Augurs;</hi> when he did any thing belonging to his Office of Prie≈øthood, he did it with great Experience, Judgment, and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; leaving all other Thoughts, and without omitting any ancient Ceremony, or adding to any new; contending oftentimes with his Companions in things which ≈øeemed light and of ≈ømall moment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto them that though we do pre≈øume the Gods are ea≈øy to be pacified, and that they readily pardon all Scapes and Faults committed by Negligence, yet if it were no more but for re≈øpect of Common-Wealths ≈øake, they ≈øhould not ≈ølightly, nor carele≈øly di≈ø≈øemble, nor pa≈øs over Faults committed in tho≈øe matters: For no Man (≈øaith he) at the fir≈øt, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65719:8"/>any Fault, doth alone trouble the State of the Commonwealth, but withall we mu≈øt think he leaveth the Grounds of civil Government that is not careful to keep the In≈øtitutions of ≈ømall matters as well as great. The Inference is obvious, and I mu≈øt leave it to you to make the Application. And now I have done with the Plea of a Di≈øpen≈øation.</p>
            <p>The next is, that it is very inconvenient for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who by rea≈øon of the di≈øtance of the Place cannot hear, and ≈øo are never the better, they neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they ≈øhould pronounce their <hi>Amen,</hi> nor when to ≈øay it; to which I an≈øwer experimentally, that though ≈øometimes it may po≈ø≈øibly ≈øo fall out, by rea≈øon of the low Voice of the Prie≈øt; yet the ≈øame Mi≈øchief attends the Desk as well as the Table: For if the Mini≈øter doth not audibly and di≈øtinctly read the Prayers (as in too many places he doth not) the People are as little edified by their being read in the Desk as at the Altar; and if they be audibly and di≈øtinctly read, they may be heard as well at the Table, as in the Desk: So that the Fault (if any be) is not occa≈øioned by the di≈øtance of the Place, ≈øo much as through the indi≈øcretion of the Reader, which he may help him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe this Inconvenience were general, and as great as you ≈øeem to make it, yet we cannot ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that the Governours of our Church ≈øhould be ≈øo ≈øhort-Sighted as not to di≈øcern it, nor yet ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as not to provide a Remedy for it: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever, be it never ≈øo inconvenient, this may be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a regular way, by tho≈øe who are authori≈øed thereunto, and the Inconvenience taken away by tho≈øe who are ve≈øted with a legal Power for that Purpo≈øe (if they think fitting ≈øo to have it.) But for any private Pari≈øh Curate to take upon him, not only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65719:8"/>to Di≈øpute, but to Judg of the Conveniency and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of a Law firmly e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Con≈øent of the whole Nation, and thereupon to alter the Law after his own Model, is no le≈øs a piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolence then to take upon him to be King, Bi≈øhop, and Prie≈øt of his own Pari≈øh, by impo≈øing his own Laws upon the People, and cancelling tho≈øe of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.</p>
            <p>Some of you ≈øay that it is very indecent for the Prie≈øt to go out of the Desk up to the Altar in his Surplice, and to come back again with his Surplice ≈øtill on, to the Homily or Sermon (which by the way, being part of Admini≈øtration of the divine Service, is to be performed with the Surplice on) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back again to read the Prayer for the Church Militant, as they are appointed to do. In An≈øwer whereunto, although my former An≈øwer to the Plea of Inconvenience might ≈øerve very well, yet by the way I cannot but ob≈øerve that the≈øe very Men, who have been ≈øo Eagle-≈øighted as to ≈øpy out this great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency; yet when the ≈øame thing is done at another place, they cannot di≈øcern the Indecency: For when a Child is to be Baptized at the Font, they can go out of the Desk in their Surplice after the ≈øecond Le≈ø≈øon, and return to the ≈øame place without any Blu≈øhing, as if the going up to the Ea≈øt end of the Church in a Surplice, were a very un≈øeemly Po≈øture, and yet going down to the We≈øt end in the ≈øame Garment, were a very comely Ge≈øture. <hi>Ri≈øum teneatis?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have you any more to ≈øay in your own defence? I pray let me hear it, that I may leave no Objection unan≈øwered: For if I cannot An≈øwer all that can be ≈øuppo≈øed again≈øt my A≈ø≈øertion, I had better ≈øay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if there be the lea≈øt colour of Rea≈øon or Argument on your Behalfs, I am willing to admit it,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65719:9"/>and ≈øtop my Pen, as ≈øoon as you have ≈øtop'd my Mouth with a convincing Rea≈øon.</p>
            <p>You ≈øay that our Governours connive at the Omi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of your Duty, they wink at your Practice, and take no notice of your doings, the Laws are not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon you, as they are upon other Per≈øons, you hear of no Inditements at the A≈ø≈øizes or Se≈ø≈øions, no Information in the Crown Office, and this to you is e≈øteem'd a ≈øufficient Warrant for your pre≈øent Practice, this ≈øeems to you a tacit Declaration, that the ≈øupreme Power doth not de≈øire his Law ≈øhould be obey'd in this particular.</p>
            <p>And by rea≈øon of this Impunity you fancy that 'tis his Maje≈øties Plea≈øure that you ≈øhould take this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty again≈øt his Laws; and therefore, than I am ju≈øtly to be Blam'd, who being but a private Per≈øon have expre≈ø≈øed greater Severity again≈øt you than the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate him≈øelf; because I have charged you with the Guilt of Sin, when the Magi≈øtrate doth not ≈øo much as puni≈øh you. Whereas in truth 'tis not I that lay any ≈øuch thing to your Charge, but the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who≈øe Words I have only quoted, that the wilful and contemptuous Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and breaking of a common Order and Di≈øcipline (as this is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we now Treat) is no ≈ømall Offence before God, as I told you before.</p>
            <p>Is not this the full Sub≈øtance of your Plea? and is not this your Logick? You are not puni≈øhed for your Di≈øobedience: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis lawful to Di≈øobey. You fancy 'tis his Maje≈øties Plea≈øure that you ≈øhould not Obey: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ≈øo. His Maje≈øties Law is not Executed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis no binding Law. What a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Non≈øequiturs</hi> are here? What kind of Syllogi≈øm will you make of this? There is ≈øuch a Steeple as <hi>Tenterden</hi> Steeple: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis the cau≈øe of <hi>Goodwin</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65719:9"/>Sands, as good an <hi>Ergo</hi> as any of the former.</p>
            <p>But I mu≈øt not let this pa≈øs thus. You ≈øay 'tis his Maje≈øties Plea≈øure you ≈øhould enjoy your Liberty in this Matter; it may be ≈øo for ought I know, but if it ≈øhould prove otherwi≈øe, as it is more than an even lay that it doth, then have you been overbold with his Sacred Maje≈øty, by pretending to be of his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Councel, which is more than probable that you are not.</p>
            <p>We his poor Subjects are ≈øatisfied with his known Will and Plea≈øure, publickly declared in his Laws, without li≈øtening at the Privy Council Door to know what his ≈øecret Will is, before it is his Plea≈øure to make it known: And as ≈øoon as his Maje≈øty graciou≈øly vouch≈øafes to declare any thing in Oppo≈øition to that which is e≈øtabli≈øhed by Law, I ≈øhall obey it with all Submi≈ø≈øion and Reverence, humbly and ≈øilently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie≈øcing in the Determination of his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, which to me is, and ≈øhall ever be a Law as binding as any Act of Parliament ≈øince the Conque≈øt. In the mean time, if his Maje≈øty hath whi≈øpered this ≈øo ≈øoftly, that none could hear it but your ≈øelves, blame not me who know nothing of the matter, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding have great cau≈øe to think that my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is not inferior to yours in this Particular.</p>
            <p>If his Maje≈øty hath communicated his private Will to you, ≈øpeak it out, and let us know it; and you ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence me for ever: But I pray have a care how you make it an Argument to ju≈øtify what you do, by ≈øaying that the King takes no notice of that Licence you have given your ≈øelf; and do not per≈øwade your ≈øelves, that 'tis as good as if you had a Licence from his Maje≈øty him≈øelf for your unlawful Practice, for ≈øo I mu≈øt make bold to call it until I know further of this matter.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65719:10"/>
            <p> I ≈øee no Proof ≈øo much as offered at for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties Plea≈øure in this Affair, except it be the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>execution of his Laws, which may be imputed to the Neglect of his Officers and Mini≈øters in the Di≈øcharge of their Duty. But if to ≈øerve your turn you will ≈øay 'tis an Argument of his Will and not of their Neglect; you mu≈øt unavoidably ≈øerve ≈øomebodies Turn be≈øides your own, therefore you had better let this Argument alone, le≈øt ≈øome others take it out of your Mouths, and make u≈øe of it again≈øt your ≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Another pretty ≈øort of Argument others make u≈øe of, which though it little de≈øerves an An≈øwer, yet I ≈øhall briefly ≈øay ≈øomething to it, and ≈øo fini≈øh with you worthy Gentlemen who confe≈øs the Command, and yet practi≈øe quite Oppo≈øite to it. You ≈øay that the People are not plea≈øed with it, otherwi≈øe you would very willingly go up to the Altar, or Holy Table, but if you ≈øhould, the People would go out of the Church, and perhaps come no more. In good time! Mu≈øt the Orders of the Church hang upon ≈øo ≈ølender a Thred, as the liking, or di≈øliking of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Multitude? Mu≈øt the Shepherd go whither the Sheep would have him, and no further, for fear of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øing the Sheep? Is the Government of our Church ≈øo precarious? If this be the Ca≈øe, you may ≈øhut up the Church Doors and write over them <hi>DOLENS DICO, GEMENS DENUNTIO, SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERDOTIUM QOUD APUD NOS INTUS CECIDIT FORISDIU STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RE NON POTER IT: CITO ENIM ACTUM ERIT DE ECCLESIA AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLICANA.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I have ≈øomething to ≈øay to you Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Sirs, who ≈øay that there is no Rubrick, neither was it ever the Intention of the Church, that there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65719:10"/>≈øhould be one for the reading the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at the North ≈øide of the Table when there is no Communion; You cannot ≈øee ≈øuch a Rubrick. What? are there no Rubricks at all to direct the orderly read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tho≈øe Prayers and other Religious Duties which are to be performed when there is no Communion? Do you never Preach but when there is a Communion? Yes, yes, there is a plain Rubrick for it, Then ≈øhall follow the Sermon. You can read that Sirs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a pair of Spectacles I perceive very well; but kind Sirs, according to your own Con≈øtruction of the Rubricks, this is only when there is a Communion: for the next immediate Rubrick is, Then ≈øhall the Prie≈øt return to the Lord's Table. Can any one be properly ≈øaid to return to the Place he was not at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And if he was at it before, then there mu≈øt be a Communion, ≈øay you; but if there be no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the appointed Rubricks ≈øerve only for Communion-time, then there is no Sermon appointed, ≈øay I, ≈øo that either you mu≈øt acknowledg that all the ≈øame Rubricks belong to the Communion Service when there is no Communion, as well as when there is one, or el≈øe what will become of your great <hi>Diana</hi> the <hi>SERMON:</hi> Methinks for the dear ≈øake of that <hi>Unum Nece≈ø≈øarium,</hi> that <hi>Magnum Oportet;</hi> you ≈øhould be more kind to that part of the Liturgy, which gives the ≈øole Authority to your Sermon. I be≈øeech you (gentle Sirs) deal not ≈øo unworthily with your own Mother, as to wink hard again≈øt the Light, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully not to ≈øee your way, when She commands you to go up to the Altar, and yet to be as quick-≈øighted as an Eagle when you a≈øcend the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>How comes it to pa≈øs that you ≈øhould be blinder than the Presbyterians, for if you do not ≈øee this Rubrick of Reading at the North ≈øide of the Table when there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65719:11"/>is no Communion 'tis really ≈øo, for they ≈øpied out this hidden Rubrick, and ≈øain would have been rid of it, it being a great Eye-≈øore to them, and they would fain have exchanged Conditions with you, that they might have been ≈øo blind as not to have ≈øeen it; but ≈øince they did too plainly Di≈øcern it, no remedy now but to de≈øire the Bi≈øhops at the grand Debate at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> when our gracious King was fir≈øt re≈øtored to his Crown, that the Mini≈øter be not required to rehear≈øe any part of the Liturgy at the Communion Table, ≈øave only tho≈øe parts which properly belong to the Lord's Supper, and that at ≈øuch time onely when the Holy Supper is Admini≈øtred. The≈øe are the very Words of their Reque≈øt, by which it appears ≈øo plain that a blind Man may ≈øee it, that by the Rubrick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Communion Office, The Prie≈øt ≈øtanding at the North-≈øide of the Table ≈øhall ≈øay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians them≈øelves, who are apt enough to pick holes in the Churches Orders if they be again≈øt their Humour, yet could not do it here; for they could make no other Con≈øtruction of it, agreeable either with Sen≈øe or Rea≈øon, but this; that at all times when any part of the Communion Service was to be read, there lay an Obligation upon all Prie≈øts, by Virtue only of that Rubrick. And the Prie≈øt ≈øtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to read that Part at the Communion Table, when there was no Communion, or el≈øe to what purpo≈øe was this Reque≈øt of theirs? and why did the Reverend Bi≈øhops make ≈øuch an An≈øwer as they did?</p>
            <p>The An≈øwer is this, That the Mini≈øter ≈øhould not Read the Communion Service at the Communion Table, is not rea≈øonable to demand, ≈øince all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church u≈øed it, and if we do not ob≈øerve that golden Rule of the venerable Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> let ancient Co≈øtoms prevail till Rea≈øon plainly requires the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65719:11"/>contrary, we ≈øhall give Offence to ≈øober Chri≈øtians by cau≈øele≈øs departure from Catholique U≈øage, and a greater Advantage to the Enemies of our Church, than our Berethren I hope would willingly grant. The Prie≈øt ≈øtanding at the Communion Table, ≈øeemeth to give us an Invitation to the Holy Sacrament, and minds us of our Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> To Receive the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ≈øome at lea≈øt every Sunday; and though we neglect our Duty, 'tis fit the Church ≈øhould keep her ≈øtanding.</p>
            <p>Ob≈øerve that, and if you find no rea≈øon in what the Reverend Bi≈øhops ≈øay, u≈øe your Liberty ≈øtill for a Cloak of Nonconformity, and remember 'tis but a Cloak, and ≈øuch a one, as you had better be ≈øtark nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than be covered with.</p>
            <p>And now it remains that I ≈øhould produce ≈øome unque≈øtionable Authorities to back my Rea≈øons, that it may appear to all unbia≈ø≈øed Per≈øons, That the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the great Worthies of our Church, who have either occa≈øionally, or on ≈øet Purpo≈øe treated of this matter, is unanimou≈øly this.</p>
            <p>The Communion Service ought to be read accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule Pre≈øcribed in our Book of Common Prayer, at the North ≈øide of the Table, as well when there is no Communion, as well as when there is one.</p>
            <p>I will begin with the mo≈øt judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who in his fifth Book, Sect. 30. hath the≈øe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> (meaning ≈øome parts of our Liturgy) <hi>are ≈øuch, as albeit they ≈øerve to ≈øingular good Purpo≈øe, even when there is no Communion Admini≈øtred, neverthele≈øs being devi≈øed at the fir≈øt for that Purpo≈øe, are at the Table of the Lord for that Cau≈øe al≈øo commonly Read.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Authority is the great Arch Bi≈øhop <hi>Land,</hi> ≈øecond unto the Reverend Father <hi>Hooker,</hi> only in time, who in a Speech in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> to which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65719:12"/>very few of you can pretend to be Strangers, ≈øay's thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Eleventh Innovation is the Reading of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Service at the Communion Table or the Altar.</hi> To this I can truly ≈øay that ≈øince my own Memory this was in u≈øe in very many Places, as being mo≈øt proper: (for tho≈øe Prayers are then Read which both precede, and follow the Communion) and by little and little this ancient Cu≈øtom was altered, and in tho≈øe places fir≈øt where the Emi≈ø≈øaries of this Faction came to Preach. And now if any one in Authority offer to reduce this ancient Cour≈øe of the Church, 'tis by and by called an Innovation. Secondly, with this the Rubricks of the Common Prayer-Book agree; for the fir≈øt Rubrick after the Communion tells us that upon Holydaies, though there be no Communion, yet all el≈øe that's appointed at the Communion ≈øhall be read. Shall be read? that's true, but where? Why the la≈øt Rubrick before the Communion tells us, that the Prie≈øt ≈øtanding at the North ≈øide of the Holy Table, ≈øhall ≈øay the Lord's Prayer with that which follows. So that not only the Communion, but the Prayers which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Communion (which are commonly called the Second Service) are to be read at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table: Therefore if this be an Innovation, 'tis made by the Rubricks, not by the Prelates.</p>
            <p>Now let us ≈øee what the Right Reverend Bi≈øhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sparrow,</hi> ≈øay's to this Matter. In his <hi>Rational</hi> of the Common Prayer <hi>p.</hi> 239. thus he ≈øay's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Private and ≈øolitary Communions of the Prie≈øt the Church allows not, and therefore when other cannot be had, ≈øhe appoints only ≈øo much of the Service as relates not of nece≈ø≈øity to a private Communion, and that to be ≈øaid at the Holy Table, and upon good Rea≈øon. The Church thereby keeping as it were her Ground, vi≈øibly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65719:12"/>minding us of what She de≈øires and labors towards our more frequent Acce≈øs to that Holy Table.</hi> Mark the ≈øeveral Rea≈øons, and weigh the great Authority of this famous Triumvirate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and then Read the Second Service hereafter in the Desk if you can.</p>
            <p>There be ≈øome others of no mean Credit in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have po≈øitively a≈ø≈øerted the ≈øame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his Introduction to Arch Bi≈øhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Life <hi>p.</hi> 22. Mr. <hi>Elborow</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of the Book of Common Prayer <hi>p.</hi> 98. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond le Strang</hi> in his Alliance of Divine Offices <hi>p.</hi> 122, 123. to which I may add a fourth, which is Dr. <hi>Combers</hi> in his Companion to the Altar, the Page I have forgot, though the Matter I very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Now if after all the≈øe Rea≈øons and Authorites there remains any Doubt, as I believe there may do with tho≈øe that are re≈øolved to doubt, that they may have ≈øome Colour for their re≈øtle≈øs Oppo≈øition to the Churches whole≈øom In≈øtitutions; I have one thing more to ≈øay, which becau≈øe it hath wrought upon ≈øome, and not only Convinced them, but Converted, as ob≈øtinate as they ≈øeemed to be, I am in good Hopes it may have the ≈øame Operation upon ≈øome others. Let me intreat all you that have any Kindne≈øs left for the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ca≈øt an impartial Eye upon the Forms of Common Prayer, upon ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Occa≈øions of Fa≈øting and Thanksgiving, ≈øet forth by Authority, ≈øhall I ≈øay, ≈øince the King's happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoration, or ≈øince the ble≈ø≈øed Reformation? Peru≈øe them all if you plea≈øe, and you ≈øhall find that in none of them all is there a Communion appointed, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny appears to be intended: but only ≈øo much of the Communion Service is therein pre≈øcribed to be Read
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65719:13"/>as on other Holydays is by the Common Prayer Book appointed to be Read when there is no Communion, and yet 'tis ≈øaid expre≈øly, The Prie≈øt ≈øtanding at the North ≈øide of the Table ≈øhall ≈øay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What more clear than this, to tell us the meaning of the Rubrick in the Book of Common Prayer, unle≈øs it be the Practice of the Prime Churches in <hi>England,</hi> the King's Chappel, the Cathedrals, the two Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities, and many Orthodox Pari≈øh Churches, to wit, that of Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> that of Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> that of Dr. <hi>Dove,</hi> and if I be not Mi≈øinformed that of Mr. <hi>Pelling,</hi> all Famous, Reverend, and Worthy Divines within the City of <hi>London,</hi> and I que≈øtion not but the pious Example of ≈øuch con≈øcientious Men, hath had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon ≈øome parts of the Country, ≈øome I am ≈øure I know, and others I have heard of; I pray God increa≈øe their Number, not by confounding the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of any who do otherwi≈øe, but by converting their Judgments, and confounding tho≈øe Devices they make u≈øe of to hinder all manner of Impre≈ø≈øion that can be made upon them either by Rea≈øon or Authority; the chiefe≈øt of which I find to be a <hi>Ne videamur ≈øemel er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r√¢≈ø≈øe.</hi> A Principle too bad to be own'd, and yet too true to be denyed: Recommending you to God's Grace, I take my Leave of you all, leaving this ≈øhort ≈øaying with you, <hi>Veritas e≈øt magna &amp; praevalebit.</hi>
